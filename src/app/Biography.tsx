          6 Years ago I began my fitness journey as a 90 pound frail, lanky,
          near emaciated teen looking to build confidence and become comfortable
          in my own skin. Although my central goal has always been muscular
          development, I quickly fell in love with strength training as an
          integral part of acquiring the physique of my dreams. Physical changes
          donâ€™t occur overnight, but chasing strength became a source of
          constant motivation for me, a goal to strive for day in and day out in
          the gym, a goal which I could see materialize from training session to
          training session.

          I'm a strong believer in programming which prioritizes strength in the
          development of oneâ€™s physique. It is the natural lifter's most
          valuable tool in being able to make sustained progress in building
          muscle mass and achieving genetic potential. Daily undulating
          periodization has been clinically demonstrated to yield the highest
          strength returns over any other method of periodization. Progressive
          tension overload is the central driver of muscle growth (hypertrophy).
          The stronger we get, the more rapidly we can increase workload volume
          and achieve progressive tension overload. This program will calculate
          your personalized, individual numbers for every workout based on the
          input of your core lift maxes; taking out the guesswork, preventing
          overreaching, and driving progressive overload each and every workout
          session. Ditch the pump and fluff workouts and cookie cutter bro
          splits that are all too common in the industry, and stick to a workout
          regimen that integrates the most optimal methods of periodization and
          exercise selection, to fulfill your long term fitness and physique
          goals.
